# DATA-4319-Machine-Learning-
Machine Learning is a field that is ever evolving, with the constant development of machines and artificial intelligence,  Machine learning has become a big attraction to data scientist. It is amazing how we are able to use data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improve its accuracy.


This repository contains different algorithms concepts that are essential in Machine Learning. There are a total of 10 algorithms that will be addressed. The repositories will be divided into two sections. 
## a) Unsupervised Machine Learning 
  1) K-Means Algorithm
## b) Supervised Machine Learning 
  2) Neutral Network
  3) Decision Trees
  4) Linear Regression 
  5)    - Gradient Descent
  6)    - Normal Equation
  7) Logistic Regression
  8) K Nearest Neighbor
  9) Perceptron
  10) Pocket Algorithm
  11) Hierarchical Clustering 

Each repository will contain a jupyter notebook, dataset used and a pdf. I will be using python programming language to explain each algorithm. 

  - Packages used in the notebooks 
  - Description of the dataset 
  - What is the algorithm?
  - How does it work ? 
  - Advantages and Disadvantges of the alogorithm 
  - How is it performed on the dataset ?
  - Examples of the algorithms being used 
  - Summary of the alogorithms
